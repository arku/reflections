What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A git directory is created in the working directory. You have to initialize a git repository to let Git know that it has to track the files in the working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository. Before commiting, files in the working directory are added to a staging area(a temporary place).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
		Using git diff --staged compares the changes made to the staging area with the latest commit. With the help of this, we can track the changes made to the staging area. So, its always a good idea to run git diff --staged after adding a file to the staging area to make surewe have one commit per logical change.
