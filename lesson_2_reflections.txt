What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A git directory is created in the working directory. You have to initialize a git repository to let Git know that it has to track the files in the working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository. Before commiting, files in the working directory are added to a staging area(a temporary place).
